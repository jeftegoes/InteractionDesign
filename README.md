- This content was extracted from the [Book Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.amazon.com.br/Interaction-Design-Beyond-Human-Computer/dp/1119547253/ref=sr_1_3?qid=1667566775&refinements=p_27%3AHelen+Sharp&s=books&sr=1-3&text=Helen+Sharp&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.e05b01e0-91a7-477e-a514-15a32325a6d6) for study.
- How many interactive products are there in everyday use?
  - Smarthphone
  - Tablet
  - Computer
  - Remote control
  - ATM (Cash machine)
  - Games console
- Now think how usable they are...
  - Smarthphone with Android are a joy to use
  - Self-checkout Macdonald's
- Many products that require **users** to **interact** with them.
  - Designed primarily with the **user** in mind.
  - Others products, have not necessarily been designed with the users in mind.
- One main aim of interaction design is:
  - Reduce the negative aspects (e.g. frustration, annoyance).
  - Enhancing the positive ones (e.g. enjoyment, engagement).

## 1.1. Good and Poor Design

- A central concern of interaction design is to develop interactive products that are usable.
- By this is generally meant easy to learn, effective to use, and providing an enjoyable user experience.

- Poor design...

  ![Registration phone good design](/Images/RegistrationPhoneGoodDesign.png)

### 1.1.1. What to Design

- Designing interactive products requires considering:
  - Who is going to be using them.
  - Wow they are going to be used.
  - Where they are going to be used.

# 2. Usability

- Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective.
- It involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their activities at work, at school, and in their everyday lives.
- More specifically, usability is broken down into the following goals:
  - Effective to use (effectiveness).
  - Efficient to use (efficiency).
  - Safe to use (safety).
  - Having good utility (utility).
  - Easy to learn (learnability).
  - Easy to remember how to use (memorability).
- Usability goals are typically operationalized as questions.
  - However, simply asking _"is the system easy to learn?"_ is not going to be very helpful.

## 2.1. Effectiveness

- **Effectiveness** is a very general goal and refers to how good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do.
  - **Question:** Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information they need, or buy the goods they want?

## 2.2. Efficiency

- **Efficiency** refers to the way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks.
- The marble answering machine described at the beginning of this chapter was considered efficient in that it let the user carry out common tasks, e.g. listening to messages, through a minimal number of steps.
  - **Question:** Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity?

## 2.3. Safety

- **Safety** involves protecting the user from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations.
  - **Question:** What is the range of errors that are possible using the product and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them?

### 2.3.1. Ergonomic aspect

- It refers to the external conditions where people work:
- For example, where there are hazardous conditions – such as:
  - X-ray machines
  - Toxic chemicals
  - Operators should be able to interact with and control computer-based systems remotely.

### 2.3.2. Helping any kind

- The second aspect refers to helping any kind of user in any kind of situation avoid the dangers of carrying out unwanted actions accidentally.
- It also refers to the perceived fears users might have of the consequences of making errors and how this affects their behavior.
- To make interactive products safer in this sense involves:
  1. Preventing the user from making serious errors by reducing the risk of wrong keys/buttons being mistakenly activated (an example is not placing the quit or delete-file command right next to the save command on a menu)
  2. Providing users with various means of recovery should they make errors.
- Safe interactive systems should engender confidence and allow the user the opportunity to explore the interface to try out new operations.
- Other safety mechanisms include undo facilities and confirmatory dialog boxes that give users another chance to consider their intentions (a well-known example is the appearance of a dialog box, after issuing the command to delete everything in the trashcan, saying: "Are you sure you want to move this folder to the Recycle Bin".

![Windows dialog delete confirmation](/Images/WindowsDialogDeleteConfirmation.png)

## 2.4. Utility

- **Utility** refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to do.
  - Examples:
    - A product with high utility is an accounting software package that provides a powerful computational tool that accountants can use to work out tax returns.
    - A product with low utility is a software drawing tool that does not allow users to draw freehand but forces them to use a mouse to create their drawings, using only polygon shapes.
  - **Question:** Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will
    enable users to carry out all their tasks in the way they want to do them?

## 2.5. Learnability

- **Learnability** refers to how easy a system is to learn to use.
- It is well known that people don't like spending a long time learning how to use a system.
- In these situations, pop-up tutorials can help by providing contextualized step-by-step material with hands-on exercises.
- A key concern is determining how much time users are prepared to spend learning a product.
  - **Question:** Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying out certain actions? How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way?

## 2.6. Memorability

- **Memorability** refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned.
- This is especially important for interactive products that are used infrequently.
- Users need to be helped to remember how to do tasks. There are many ways of designing the interaction to support this.
- For example, users can be helped to remember the sequence of operations at different stages of a task through meaningful icons, command names, and menu options.
  - **Question:** What kinds of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for products and operations they use infrequently?

# 3. Interface and Interaction

## 3.1. Interface

### 3.1.1. Introduction

- Until the mid-1990s, interaction designers concerned themselves largely with developing efficient and effective user interfaces for desktop computers aimed at the single user.
- Advances in graphical interfaces, speech, gesture and handwriting recognition, together with the arrival of the Internet, smartphones, wireless networks, sensor technologies, and an assortment of other new technologies providing large and small displays, have changed the face of human–computer interaction.
- The range of technological developments has encouraged different ways of thinking about interaction design and an expansion of research in the field.
- For example, innovative ways of controlling and interacting with digital information have been developed that include gesture-based, touch-based, and even brain–computer interaction. Researchers and developers have combined the physical and digital in novel ways, resulting in mixed realities, augmented realities, tangible interfaces, and wearable computing.
- A major thrust has been to design new interfaces that extend beyond the individual user: supporting small-and large-scale social interactions for people on the move, at home, and at work.

#### 3.1.1.1. Interfaces

- There is now a diversity of interfaces, the principals:
  - Web
  - Mobile
  - Virtual reality
  - Speech
  - Pen
  - Touch

## 3.2. Interaction (Design interaction)

### 3.2.1. Definitions

- By interaction design, we mean:
  - _Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives._
- Different aspects by authors
  - Winograd describes it as _"designing spaces for human communication and interaction" (1997, p. 160)_.
  - Thackara views it as _"the why as well as the how of our daily interactions using computers"(2001, p. 50)_.
  - Saffer emphasizes its artistic aspects: _"the art of facilitating interactions between humans through products and services" (2010, p. 4)_.
- The focus of interaction design is very much concerned with practice, i.e. how to design user experiences.
- How does interaction design differ from other approaches to the design of computer-based systems, such as software engineering?
- A simple analogy to another profession, concerned with creating buildings, may clarify this difference.
- In his account of interaction design, Winograd (1997) asks how architects and civil engineers differ when faced with the problem of building a house.
  - Architects are concerned with the people and their interactions with each other and with the house being built. For example, is there the right mix of family and private spaces? Are the spaces for cooking and eating in close proximity? Will people live in the space being designed in the way it was intended to be used?
  - In contrast, engineers are interested in issues to do with realizing the project. These include practical concerns like cost, durability, structural aspects, environmental aspects, fire regulations, and construction methods. Just as there is a difference between designing and building a house, so too is there a distinction between designing an interactive product and engineering the software for it.

### 3.2.2. The components of Interaction Design

![Interdisciplinary overlapping fields](/Images/InterdisciplinaryOverlappingFields.png)

### 3.2.3. The User Experience

- The user experience (UX) is central to interaction design.
- By this it is meant how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world.
- Nielsen and Norman (2014) define it as encompassing "all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products."
- As stressed by _Garrett (2010, p. 10), "every product that is used by someone has a user experience: newspapers, ketchup bottles, reclining armchairs, cardigan sweaters._"
- It is important to point out that one cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience.
- In particular, one cannot design a enjoyable experience, but only create the design features that can evoke it.
  - For example, the outside case of a cell phone can be designed to be smooth, silky, and fit in the palm of a hand; when held, touched, looked at, and interacted with, that can provoke a enjoyable and satisfying user experience.
  - Conversely, if it is designed to be heavy and awkward to hold, it is much more likely to end up providing a poor user experience, one that is uncomfortable and unpleasant.

### 3.2.4. The Process of Interaction Design

- The process of interaction design involves five basic activities:

1. Establishing requirements.
2. Designing alternatives.
3. Prototyping.
4. Evaluating.
5. Accessibility.

#### 3.2.4.1. Establishing requirements.

- In order to design something to support people, we must know who our target users are and what kind of support an interactive product could usefully provide.
- These needs form the basis of the product's requirements and underpin subsequent design and development.
- This activity is fundamental to a user-centered approach, and is very important in interaction design.

#### 3.2.4.2. Designing alternatives.

- This is the core activity of designing: actually suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements.
- This activity can be viewed as two sub-activities:
  - Conceptual design and concrete design:
    - **Conceptual design** involves producing the conceptual model for the product, and a conceptual model describes an abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it.
    - **Concrete design considers** the detail of the product including the colors, sounds, and images to use, menu design, and icon design. Alternatives are considered at every point.

#### 3.2.4.3. Evaluating

- Evaluating what has been built is very much at the heart of interaction design.
- Its focus is on ensuring that the product is appropriate.
- It is usually addressed through a user-centered approach to design, which, as the name suggests, seeks to involve users throughout the design process.
- There are many different ways of achieving this:
  - Through observing users
  - Talking to them
  - Interviewing them
  - Modeling their performance
  - Asking them to fill in questionnaires
  - Even asking them to become co-designers.

#### 3.2.4.4. Prototyping

- A prototype is one manifestation of a design that allows stakeholders to interact with it and to explore its suitability; it is limited in that a prototype will usually emphasize one set of product characteristics and de-emphasize others.
- When you hear the term prototype, you may imagine a scale model of a building or a bridge, or a piece of software that crashes every few minutes.
- A prototype can also be a paper-based outline of a display, a collection of wires and ready-made components, an electronic picture, a video simulation, a complex piece of software and hardware, or a three-dimensional mockup of a workstation.

#### 3.2.4.5. Accessibility

- Accessibility refers to the degree to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible.
- A focus is on people with disabilities.
- But what does it mean to be disabled? Definitions vary, but the following captures the main points.
  - People are considered to be disabled if:
    - They have a mental or physical impairment.
    - The impairment has an adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
- It is quite common, when people first consider the topic of accessibility and interaction design, to consider it largely in terms of a specific physical disability, such as the inability to walk or being visually impaired.
- However, it can often be the case that a person will have more than one disability.
- There is a wide range of disabilities including:
- **Color-blindness:** The inability to distinguish between two colors affects approximately 1 in 10 men and 1 in 200 women.
  - This has an impact on the use of color for highlighting or distinguishing interface elements.
- **Dyslexia:** Although usually associated with difficulties in reading and writing, there are many different forms of dyslexia, some of which affect the way in which people comprehend the totality of concepts.
  - A relatively simple interaction design decision that can cause difficulties for people with dyslexia is the contrast between foreground and background text or images.
- **Physical impairments:** These range from conditions such as tremor or shaking, weakness, pain, reduced control of limbs, inability to sit upright, to short or missing limbs.

## 3.3. Interface vs Interaction

- Interaction design determines what's on the screen and how people use those elements.
- Interface design determines what those elements look like.

# 4. Prototyping

- It is often said that users can't tell you what they want, but when they see something and get to use it, they soon know what they don't want.
- Having established some requirements, the next step is to try out design ideas through prototyping and evaluation cycles.

## 4.1. What Is a Prototype?

- A prototype is one manifestation of a design that allows stakeholders to interact with it and to explore its suitability; it is limited in that a prototype will usually emphasize one set of product characteristics and de-emphasize others.
- In fact, a prototype can be anything from a paper-based storyboard through to a complex piece of software, and from a cardboard mockup to a molded or pressed piece of metal.

## 4.2. Why Prototype?

- Prototypes answer questions and support designers in choosing between alternatives.
- Hence, they serve a variety of purposes:
  - Test out the technical feasibility of an idea.
  - Clarify some vague requirements.
  - To do some user testing and evaluation.
  - Check that a certain design direction is compatible with the rest of product development.

## 4.3. Low-Fidelity Prototyping

- A low-fidelity prototype does not look very much like the final product and does not provide the same functionality.
- Low-fidelity prototypes are useful because they tend to be simple, cheap, and quick to produce.
  - This also means that they are simple, cheap, and quick to modify so they support the exploration of alternative designs and ideas.
- This is particularly important in early stages of development, during conceptual design for example, because prototypes that are used for exploring ideas should be flexible and encourage exploration and modification.
- Low-fidelity prototypes are not meant to be kept and integrated into the final product.
- They are for exploration only.

### 4.3.1. Storyboarding.

- Storyboarding is one example of low-fidelity prototyping that is often used in conjunction with scenarios.
- A storyboard consists of a series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task using the product under development.
- It can be a series of screen sketches or a series of scenes showing how a user can perform a task using an interactive device.
- When used in conjunction with a scenario, the storyboard provides more detail and offers stakeholders a chance to role-play with a prototype, interacting with it by stepping through the scenario.
- An example storyboarding:
  ![Example of storyboarding](/Images/Storyboarding.png)

### 4.3.2. Sketching

- Low-fidelity prototyping often relies on hand-drawn sketches, and many people find it difficult to engage in this activity because they are inhibited about the quality of their drawing, but as _Greenberg et al (2012) put it, "Sketching is not about drawing. Rather, it is about design" (p. 7)_.
- You can get over any inhibition by devising your own symbols and icons and practicing them – referred to by Greenberg et al as a 'sketching vocabulary' (p. 85).
- They don't have to be anything more than simple boxes, stick figures, and stars.
- Elements you might require in a storyboard sketch, for example, include digital devices, people, emotions, tables, books, etc., and actions such as give, find, transfer, and write.
- If you are sketching an interface design, then you might need to draw various icons, dialog boxes, and so on.
- Sketching example:
  ![Example of sketching](/Images/Sketching.png)

## 4.4. High-Fidelity Prototyping

- A high-fidelity prototype looks like the final product and/or provides more functionality than a low-fidelity prototype.

## 4.5. Vantages and disadvantages of low and high fidelity prototypes

| Type                    | Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# 5. Context of use

- Environmental requirements – or **context of use** – refer to the circumstances in which the interactive product will operate.
- Four aspects of the environment must be considered when establishing requirements:
  - Physical environment.
  - Social environment.
  - Organizational environment.
  - Technical environment.

## 5.1. Physical environment

- Physical environment, such as how much lighting, noise, movement, and dust is expected in the operational environment.
- Will users need to wear protective clothing, such as large gloves or headgear that might affect the choice of interface type? How crowded is the environment?
- For example, an ATM operates in a very public physical environment – using a speech interface is therefore likely to be problematic.

![ATM](/Images/ATM.jpg)
![Gloves](/Images/InterfaceWithGloves.jpg)

## 5.2. Social environment

- Human beings are inherently social; people will always need to collaborate, coordinate, and communicate with one another, and the diverse range of applications, web-based services, and technologies that have emerged are enabling them to do so in more extensive and diverse ways.
- For example, will data need to be shared? If so, does the sharing have to be synchronous (e.g. does everyone need to be viewing the data at once?) or asynchronous (e.g. two people authoring a report take turns in editing it)? Other factors include the physical location of fellow team members, e.g. do collaborators need to communicate across great distances?

## 5.3. Organizational environment

- Organizational environment, e.g.:
  - How good is user support likely to be, how easily can it be obtained, and are there facilities or resources for training?
  - How efficient or stable is the communications infrastructure? And so on.

## 5.4. Technical environment

- Will need to be established: for example, what technologies will the product run on or need to be compatible with, and what technological limitations might be relevant?
